This project contains latest compiled v8 libraries for Android in Arm and Arm64 flavours.
Tested and ready to use !!

Currently only V8 6.4 (or lkgr at the time we compiled it) is supported.
We plan to add newer versions as they are ready to ship.

You will find a compressed .zip file for each v8 version available.
Its contents is direct contents to be deployed in an Android project's `jni` folder.

It has the following structure:

 + arm64-v8a: arm64 binary libraries.
 + armeabi-v7a: arm7 binary libraries.
 + include: minimum v8 compilation include files.
 + v8_include_src: internal v8 files needed to compile your project if using inspector.
