This project contains latest compiled v8 libraries for Android in Arm and Arm64 flavours.
Tested and ready to use !!

Each folder contains all necessary files to have an Android app successfully running embedded v8.
The `include` folder contains basic hader files needed to compile an Android Apk.
If you need to make use of v8's `inspector` capabilities, you'll need to include the `src` folder as include source for your project as well.

In both `arm` and `arm64` folders you must uncompress `libv8_base.a.zip` file. 
This file contains the main v8 library file (base, libbase, libplatform, libsampler and libinspector).
It ships compressed for the evident file sizes (>100Mb)

Currently only V8 6.4 (or lkgr at the time we compiled it) is supported.
We plan to add newer versions as they are ready to ship.
